This document summarizes the fixes and improvements made to the web application.

1.  **Cart Quantity and Uniqueness**
    *   **Challenge**: When adding a product to the cart, the quantity was not being calculated correctly. Products with different sizes were treated as the same item, causing the quantity to be incremented instead of adding a new, unique item to the cart.
    *   **Solution**: The logic in `firebase.js` and `CartContext.jsx` was updated to check for both the product `id` and `size`. This ensures that items with different sizes are treated as unique entries in the cart.

2.  **Cart Icon Display**
    *   **Challenge**: The cart icon was displaying the total quantity of all items, rather than the number of unique products.
    *   **Solution**: The `CartIcon.jsx` component was modified to display the length of the `cartItems` array, which accurately reflects the number of unique products in the cart.

3.  **Page Refresh on Quantity Change**
    *   **Challenge**: The cart page was refreshing every time the quantity of an item was updated.
    *   **Solution**: Redundant event listeners were removed from `firebase.js`. This stopped the cart from reloading every time a quantity was changed, which fixed the flickering and refreshing issue.

4.  **Wishlist Feedback**
    *   **Challenge**: There was no user notification when an item was added to the wishlist.
    *   **Solution**: A toast notification was added to the `ProductCard.jsx` component to provide feedback when an item is added to or removed from the wishlist.

5.  **Wishlist UI and Layout**
    *   **Challenge**: The "Remove from Wishlist" button was poorly placed, and the overall design of the wishlist page was outdated.
    *   **Solution**: The wishlist page was redesigned with a more modern and user-friendly layout. The "Remove from Wishlist" button was moved to a more intuitive location next to the product name.

6.  **Cart Repopulation After Clearing**
    *   **Challenge**: After clearing the cart and refreshing the page, the cart would repopulate with the old items. This was caused by a race condition where the cart was loading data from local storage before the user's authentication status was confirmed.
    *   **Solution**: The `AuthContext` and `CartContext` were refactored to ensure that the cart only loads its data after the authentication process is complete. This eliminated the race condition and prevented the cart from loading stale data.

7.  **Authentication and Routing**
    *   **Challenge**: After logging in, the app would not recognize the user's logged-in state, which prevented access to protected pages like the cart.
    *   **Solution**: The `ProtectedRoute.jsx` component was updated to correctly check for the `currentUser` object from the `useAuth` hook. This resolved the issue and ensured that the user's authentication state was correctly recognized throughout the application.
